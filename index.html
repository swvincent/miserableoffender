			Welcome, I'm Scott, and I'm a miserable offender. If you don't know what that is, I suggest reading or listening to 
			<a href="https://johnkoessler.com/2020/11/04/us-miserable-offenders/">Us Miserable Offenders</a> by John Koessler.
		</p>
		<p>
			What follows here is a list of quotes and bits of scripture that relate to "Miserable Offenders" and to the use and language of Common Prayer.

		<blockquote cite="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/MP.htm">
			But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent; 
			According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord.

		<blockquote cite="https://anglicanhistory.org/usa/advent/misoff.html">
			I do not think whether we are feeling miserable or not matters. I think it is using the word miserable in the old sense -- meaning an object of pity...
			The Prayer Book does not mean that we should feel miserable but that if we could see things from a sufficient height above we should all realize that we are in fact proper objects of pity.

		<blockquote>
			Few people feel at any given moment as though they are indeed "miserable sinners," and to modern ears the phrase 
			sounds unhealthily self-lacerating, but... the Latin original clarifies. "Miserable" is derived from <em>miseria</em> - 
			the familiar liturgical phrase <em>miserere me, Domine</em> means "have mercy on me, Lord" - so a "miserable sinner" is 
			simply "a sinner in need of mercy."

			The expressions, used [in The Confession] to acknowledge the wickedness of sin and the defects of human life, will seem to be excessive whenever we are making 
			light of our faults. But in proportion as we realise the perfection of God's holiness, we shall find them suitable to every shade of defect and sin.

		<blockquote>
			The idea that I must always find my own words, that I must generate my own devotion from scratch every morning, 
			that unless I think of new words I must be spiritually lazy or deficient - that has the all-too-familiar sign of human pride, 
			of "doing it my way": of, yes, works-righteousness.

			When the Book of Common Prayer calls us miserable sinners, it is both a recognition of what we are and a reminder of God’s response. Specifically, 
			it tells us that we are those whose moral condition is so deplorable that the only remedy is the goodness and mercy of God, no matter how we may feel.

			Does that sound very gloomy? Does Christianity encourage morbid introspection? The alternative is much more morbid.
