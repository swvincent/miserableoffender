		<blockquote cite="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1928/MP.htm">
			But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord.

		<blockquote cite="https://anglicanhistory.org/usa/advent/misoff.html">
			I do not think whether we are feeling miserable or not matters. I think it is using the word miserable in the old sense -- meaning an object of pity...
			The Prayer Book does not mean that we should feel miserable but that if we could see things from a sufficient height above we should all realize that we are in fact proper objects of pity.

		<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018.13&version=NASB">
			But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to raise his eyes toward heaven, but was beating his chest, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner!'

		<blockquote cite="https://anglicanhistory.org/usa/advent/misoff.html">
			Does that sound very gloomy? Does Christianity encourage morbid introspection? The alternative is much more morbid. 
			Those who do not think about their own sins make up for it by thinking incessantly about the sins of others. 
			It is healthier to think of one's own.
